The aim of the society is to impart mathematical culture within the community with the help of various activities, workshops and other events. MATRIX 1.0 was a full day affair comprising of four components, namely, Mathematical Quiz, screening of the movie ‘The Man Who Knew Infinity’, Mathematical Rangoli and Mathematical Games. The entire event was open for students of all colleges and departments. Anyone who had some interest in mathematics was welcome.

</p>

             <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word; font-family:Lora,'Times New Roman',serif;"> The day started with ‘Mathematical Quiz’ which had students participating individually in the first round and then paired in teams of two as they qualified for further rounds. While the first round of the quiz dealt mainly with logical reasoning, analytical ability and questions requiring an insight into the mathematical concepts, the second round, which had qualified participants teamed up randomly in pairs, dealt with the philosophical and historical aspects of the developments in the field of mathematics. The third and final round of the quiz was a rather interesting one requiring the finalists to first solve a jigsaw puzzle and then figure out the question at the back of it to answer before everyone else in order to emerge as winners.
