<p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Olympics, the biggest festival of sports is already on, a full on play of power, stamina, accuracy and patience. Talking about power sports, have you ever wondered, how and why the wrestlers or other players of power sports have bulging out or thickened ears?</p>

             <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Well, it is due to their form of sport. It is an interesting phenomenon called as 'Cauliflower ear' which arises as a result of repeated blows around that body part. It is called as such due to its shape. When the cartilage i.e. the upper portion of the ear is injured due to any serious blow, the blood flow from the skin is disrupted, often forming a large pocket of blood known as 'hematoma'.The cartilage of the ear has no other blood supply except that supplied by the overlying skin. When the skin is pulled from the cartilage, and/or separated from the cartilage by blood (as with accumulated blood from injury or inflammation, or infection), the cartilage is deprived of important nutrients. Ultimately, the cartilage dies and the risk of infection is increased.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">As the injury to the ear starts healing (without treatment) it can shrivel up and fold in on itself and appear pale, giving it a cauliflower like appearance.Once cartilage death and scarring (fibrosis) occurs, the resulting deformity is generally permanent.Wrestlers, boxers, rugby players and martial artists considering the nature of their sports are more susceptible to this type of injury.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>Causes:</b><br> As it arises due to repeated severe blows in ear, therefore it mostly occursbecause of playing these kinds of power sports. Although there are few more causes of it which are less prevalent. Cartilage damage may also result from piercing the upper ear in the cartilage. "Piercing can lead to a type of ear cartilage infection called 'auricular perichondritis &apos;, which can result in cauliflower ear." Also, an even more rare cause of it can be damage or inflammation to the cartilage of various organs of body mostly ear or nose due to a pretty rare disorder known as relapsing polychondritis. These are the most profound causes of cauliflower ear. Treatment:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"><b>Treatment:</b><br>The goals of treatment are to prevent permanent damage to the cartilage by draining blood from the hematoma, treating any infection, and reducing inflammation in order to re-establish the connection of the skin to the underlying cartilage. Antibiotics are prescribed to prevent infection. Patients can be treated by an ear, nose, and throat doctor (otolaryngologist) or plasticsurgeon to treat this deformity and assure proper healing. Cauliflower ear repair consists of draining accumulated blood (the hematoma) through an incision in the ear and applying a compressive dressing to sandwich the two sides of the skin against the cartilage</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">As you have seen also, the headgears which rugby players and wrestlers used to wear during the play are the most effective preventive measure against the cauliflower ear.</p>
