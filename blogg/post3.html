<p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">By <b>Syed Maaz Hasan</b></p>


<p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">When Ornithologist Rafael Bessa participated in the Brazilian bird watching festival (2015), he was willing to reveal a secret many has wondered for centuries. His talk, entitled "Species X" , attracted more than a hundred curious birders and researchers.  He briefly mentioned the history of Brazil's  Ghost Birds species such as the golden- crowned Manakin and the cherry-throated Tanager.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">After building suspense in the audience, he played the recordings of the newest "Ghost Bird". He has recorded and photographed the elusive blue- eyed ground Dove with blue freckles, cinnamon-stained body and unique by its nature. It has been seen only a countable number of times since the time it has been discovered in the 1823. Also the presence of this bird had not been documented since 1941, which means for around 75 years. Non- existence of photographs and recordings caused the conjecture amongst the scientists to debate over whether the bird has blue eyes or not.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">One can easily get confused enough from the idea of "Ghost Birds",  try pronouncing "Lepidothrix vilasboas"(Manakin) and "Nemosia rourei" (tanager) which are the weird alienated scientific names of these bird. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">The Bird was discovered in the Brazilian Cerrado, the tropical savanna grasslands that cover around 21 % of Brazil. Bessa was conducting an ecological survey in the state of Minas, Gerais in 2015, when he suddenly stepped into an unfamiliar area of Cerrado. After some exploration, the veteran birder picked up a tune he never heard of before. The following day, he returned to the same location and recreated the bird call, it wasn't too late when he found himself zooming the lens into the blue-eyed ghost dove.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">"I photographed the animal and when I looked at the picture carefully, I saw that I had I recorded something extraordinary. I began to shiver."Bessa told the Brazilian newspaper Estadao.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">This Amazing recent discovery in Brazil is fascinating for the country in general. But the question one should ask is "Will this bring any good fortune for Brazil in Rio, as they have hosted the Olympics"?  I wonder if a Golden discovery can become the pinnacle of swinging away the gold tally. Rio Olympics should be used as a platform to highlight the idea of conservation of wildlife and natural habitat protection. From the day of the discovery of blue-eyed dove, Pedro Develey, The Executive Director of 'SAVE Brasil' is concerned about the threats like fire and poachers when the lives of rare doves are at stake. His organization is fundraising to purachase the dove territory and he will shortly dispatch a team to mount the come back for this Peculiar natured bird. "The moment with this dove was no less than a miracle in my life" says Bessa. 
 We hope that Brazil continue its legacy in the current Olympics in the same way as of the "ghost Species".</p>
